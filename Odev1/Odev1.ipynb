You can do various things to the kernel, such as restart it, interrupt it, and so forth. Please browse the `Kernel` menu at the top of the page.\n",

    "Your code should also work when a single point is passed (so that `x.size` and `y.size` are equal to $N=1$). This corner case reveals another quirk of numpy. Specifically, the matrix $A$ in that case has a single row (and is possibly a single number if  $k=0$  as well). However, `numpy.linalg.lstsq` expects its first argument to be a two-dimensional array, while we now have a zero- or one-dimensional array. This will raise an error when the function is called if you use `np.array` to hold your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use `np.matrix`, which distinguishes between row vectors and column vectors, and handles low-dimensional matrices more gracefully for linear algebra applications. We pass `np.array` arguments to `fit` because these are the more commonly used containers and are more convenient to use in several ways. Because of this, you need to cast np.array objects to `np.matrix` objects inside `fit`. If `arr` is an `np.array`, just say <pre>mat = np.matrix(arr)</pre> to make a matrix mat out of it. If arr is a one-dimensional array, to make sure that the corresponding matrix has a single column, rather than a single row, you need to explicitly reshape the result: <pre>col = np.reshape(np.matrix(arr), [arr.size, 1])</pre>\n",
